## What is this?

This package is a [unified][] ([remark][]) plugin to turn links (`[text](url)`)
and images (`![alt](url)`) into references (`[text][id]`, `![alt][id]`) and
definitions (`[id]: url`).

**unified** is a project that transforms content with abstract syntax trees
(ASTs).
**remark** adds support for markdown to unified.
**mdast** is the markdown AST that remark uses.
This is a remark plugin that transforms mdast.

## When should I use this?

This project is useful when you want to transform markdown and prefer that it
uses references and definitions.
Long URLs in source code can make reading markdown difficult.
References and definitions improve that by moving those URLs into definitions,
outside of paragraphs.

This plugin is very similar to the alternative
[`remark-reference-links`][remark-reference-links].
The difference is that that plugin generates numeric identifiers at the end of
the document, whereas this plugin generates identifiers based on hostnames of
URLs at the end of each section.

A different plugin, [`remark-inline-links`][remark-inline-links], does the
inverse: turn references and definitions into links and images.

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c).
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-defsplit
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import remarkDefsplit from 'https://esm.sh/remark-defsplit@4'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import remarkDefsplit from 'https://esm.sh/remark-defsplit@4?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

Say we have the following file `example.md`:

```markdown
# Some project

[![Build](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-defsplit/workflows/main/badge.svg)](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-defsplit/actions)

## Section

[A link](https://example.com)
```

And our module `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import {read} from 'to-vfile'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkDefsplit from 'remark-defsplit'

main()

async function main() {
  const file = await remark()
    .use(remarkDefsplit)
    .process(await read('example.md'))

  console.log(String(file))
}
```

Now running `node example.js` yields:

```markdown
# Some project

[github-2]: https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-defsplit/actions

## Section

[A link][example-1]

[example-1]: https://example.com
```

> ðŸ‘‰ **Note**: Observe that definitions are added at the end of each section
> and that IDs are generated based on the hostname of URLs.

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkDefsplit`.

### `unified().use(remarkDefsplit[, options])`

Plugin to change links and images to references with separate definitions.

###### `options.id`

Identifiers to use for new definitions instead of autogenerated ones (`string`
or `string[]`, default: `[]`).
For example, when given one ID, then the first link or image will use that ID
for the reference and definition.
When another link or image is seen, itâ€™ll get an autogenerated ID.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports an `Options` type, which specifies the interface of the accepted
options.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with all maintained
versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
Our projects sometimes work with older versions, but this is not guaranteed.

This plugin works with `unified` version 6+ and `remark` version 7+.

## Security

Use of `remark-defsplit` does not involve **[rehype][]** (**[hast][]**) or user
content so there are no openings for [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attacks.
