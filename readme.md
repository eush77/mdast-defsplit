[**remark**][remark] plugin to change links and images to references with
separate definitions.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-defsplit
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`.

```markdown
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/remarkjs/remark-defsplit.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/remarkjs/remark-defsplit)
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
var vfile = require('to-vfile')
var remark = require('remark')
var defsplit = require('remark-defsplit')

remark()
  .use(defsplit, {id: ['travis-badge', 'travis']})
  .process(vfile.readSync('example.md'), function(err, file) {
    if (err) throw err
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```markdown
[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis]

[travis-badge]: https://travis-ci.org/remarkjs/remark-defsplit.svg?branch=main

[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/remarkjs/remark-defsplit
```

## API

### `remark().use(defsplit[, options])`

Change links and images to references with separate definitions.

###### `options.id`

Identifiers to use for new definitions instead of autogenerated ones (`string`
or `Array.<String>`, default: `[]`).

## Security

Use of `remark-defsplit` does not involve [**rehype**][rehype]
([**hast**][hast]) or user content so there are no openings for
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attacks.

*   [`remark-reference-links`][remark-reference-links]
    — Practically the same as `remark-defsplit`, but with numeric identifiers
    instead of URI-based ones
*   [`remark-inline-links`][remark-inline-links]
    — Reverse, thus rewriting references and definitions into links and images
