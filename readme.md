[**remark**][remark] plugin to change links and images to references with
separate definitions.

## Note!

This plugin is ready for the new parser in remark
([`remarkjs/remark#536`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/pull/536)).
No change is needed: it works exactly the same now as it did before!

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-defsplit
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`.

```markdown
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/remarkjs/remark-defsplit.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/remarkjs/remark-defsplit)
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
import {readSync} from 'to-vfile'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkDefsplit from 'remark-defsplit'

const file = readSync('example.md')

remark()
  .use(remarkDefsplit, {id: ['travis-badge', 'travis']})
  .process(file)
  .then((file) => {
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```markdown
[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis]

[travis-badge]: https://travis-ci.org/remarkjs/remark-defsplit.svg?branch=main

[travis]: https://travis-ci.org/remarkjs/remark-defsplit
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkDefsplit`.

### `unified().use(remarkDefsplit[, options])`

Change links and images to references with separate definitions.

###### `options.id`

Identifiers to use for new definitions instead of autogenerated ones (`string`
or `Array.<String>`, default: `[]`).

## Security

Use of `remark-defsplit` does not involve [**rehype**][rehype]
([**hast**][hast]) or user content so there are no openings for
[cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss] attacks.

## Related

*   [`remark-reference-links`][remark-reference-links]
    — Practically the same as `remark-defsplit`, but with numeric identifiers
    instead of URI-based ones
*   [`remark-inline-links`][remark-inline-links]
    — Reverse, thus rewriting references and definitions into links and images
